## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-animated-glow
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-native-animated-glow
```

### Peer Dependencies

This library relies on `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-svg`. You must install them and follow their respective setup instructions. This is the most common source of issues!

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-svg
```

-   [React Native Reanimated Installation Guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation)
-   [React Native SVG Installation Guide](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#installation)

## Usage

### Basic Example

```jsx
import AnimatedGlow from 'react-native-animated-glow';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <AnimatedGlow>
      <View style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: '#222' }}>
        <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>I'm Glowing!</Text>
      </View>
    </AnimatedGlow>
  );
}
```

### Using a Preset

The real power comes from using presets. The included preset file can be found in the demo app source code.

```jsx
import AnimatedGlow from 'react-native-animated-glow';
import { glowPresetsPro } from './path/to/your/presets'; // Get presets from the demo app

function HotFlameButton() {
  return (
    <AnimatedGlow preset={glowPresetsPro.hotFlame} cornerRadius={50}>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 40, padding: 20 }}>üî•</Text>
    </AnimatedGlow>
  );
}
```

### Overriding a Preset

You can easily override any value from a preset by passing it as a prop.

```jsx
<AnimatedGlow
  preset={glowPresetsPro.hotFlame}
  animationSpeed={5} // Makes the animation much faster
  borderColor="cyan"
>
  <Text>Fast Flame!</Text>
</AnimatedGlow>
```

## Props API

All props are optional except for `children`. You can mix and match them to create unique effects or override values from a `preset`. For a full breakdown, please see the [interactive docs](https://reactnativeglow.com).
