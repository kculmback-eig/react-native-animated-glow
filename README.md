![React Native Animated Glow Wrapper Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realimposter/react-native-animated-glow-wrapper/main/assets/react-native-glow-demo.gif)

A fully customizable, performant, animated glow effect wrapper for any React Native component, powered by Reanimated 2 and SVG.

## Features

-   **Highly Performant:** All animations run on the native UI thread thanks to React Native Reanimated.
-   **Fully Customizable:** Control colors, speed, size, opacity, shape, and more for two independent glow layers.
-   **Preset System:** Easily apply complex styles by passing a simple preset object.
-   **Easy to Use:** Wrap any component in `<AnimatedGlowWrapper>` to apply the effect instantly.
-   **Lightweight:** No heavy dependencies outside of Reanimated and SVG.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-animated-glow-wrapper
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-native-animated-glow-wrapper
```

### Peer Dependencies

This library relies on `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-svg`. You must install them and follow their respective setup instructions.

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-svg
```

-   [React Native SVG Installation Guide](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#installation)

## Usage

### Basic Example

```jsx
import AnimatedGlowWrapper from 'react-native-animated-glow-wrapper';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <AnimatedGlowWrapper>
      <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
        <Text>I'm Glowing!</Text>
      </View>
    </AnimatedGlowWrapper>
  );
}
```

### Using a Preset

The real power comes from using presets. You can define your own or use our official preset packs.

```jsx
import AnimatedGlowWrapper from 'react-native-animated-glow-wrapper';
import { glowPresetsPro } from './path/to/your/presets'; // Your local preset file

function HotFlameButton() {
  return (
    <AnimatedGlowWrapper preset={glowPresetsPro.hotFlame}>
      <Text>üî•</Text>
    </AnimatedGlowWrapper>
  );
}
```

### Overriding a Preset

You can easily override any value from a preset by passing it as a prop.

```jsx
<AnimatedGlowWrapper
  preset={glowPresetsPro.hotFlame}
  animationSpeed={5} // Makes the animation much faster
  borderColor="cyan"
>
  <Text>Fast Flame!</Text>
</AnimatedGlowWrapper>
```

## Props API

All props are optional except for `children`. You can mix and match them to create unique effects or override values from a `preset`.
